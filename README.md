# Machine-Learning-Keras-and-Tensorflow
In this this repository, I will work on machine learning models with Keras and TensorFlow assignments or expalmes on Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow book second edition from Aurelien Geron\ 
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/\
Another reference that I will use is "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning" from Coursera by Laurence Moroney
